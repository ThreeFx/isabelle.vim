# isabelle.vim

Supporting plugin for [`coc-isabelle`](https://github.com/ThreeFx/coc-isabelle).
It defines the dynamic syntax highlighting groups used by coc-isabelle, as well
normal Isabelle/Isar syntax.

This plugin can be used standalone, however it will only provide static syntax
highlighting and symbol substitution. In order to take full advantage of the
Isabelle/VSCode language server (which is only called VSCode, it is a generic
language server).
